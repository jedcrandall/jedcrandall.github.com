## Office Hours

Thursdays 9am to 11am in
[Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/CrandallSpring2024OfficeHours) and in person at
BYENG 574.  I may forget to get online, so if you're trying to attend online
and I'm not there please shoot me a quick email and I'll jump into Jitsi. 

## TAs

I'll announce the TA's name(s) and office hours early in the semester.  Please
do not contact the TA directly, all course-related communications with the TA
should be through online discussion or office hours.

For course logistics questions message the instructor (Prof. Crandall) directly
(preferably through Canvas, but email is okay).  For anything where you may
require some accomodation there needs to be a paper trail, so email the
instructor directly.  The TA only helps with homeworks and course logistics
like attendance, so there is no reason to email them about your attendance,
extensions, etc.

## Course Description

- Students will identify different strategies for CPU scheduling.
- Students will compare different types of interprocess communication.
- Sutdents will compare different ways of implementing distributed systems.



## Enrollment Requirements

Prerequisite(s): Computer Engineering or Computer Science or Robotics & Autonomous Systems (Artificial Intelligence) graduate student OR Online Computer Science nondegree-seeking graduate student

## Grading Policies, Assignments, and Required Materials

The grade will be calculated as follows:

- Attendance is 20% of the grade and will be self-graded, with a rubric that is described below.
- Two sets of homeworks are each 10% of the
grade, for 20% total.
- There will be a Midterm and a Final Exam that are each worth 15% of the grade, so 30% total.
- There will be a final project worth 30% of the grade.

Final letter grades are based on the following scale where x is the percentage: 97.0 <= x <= 100.0 is an A+, 93.0 <= x < 97.0 is an A, 90.0 <= x < 93.0 is an A-, 87.0 <= x < 90.0 is an B+, 83.0 <= x < 87.0 is an B, 80.0 <= x < 83.0 is an B-, 77.0 <= x < 80.0 is an C+, 73.0 <= x < 77.0 is an C, 70.0 <= x < 73.0 is an C-, 60.0 <= x < 70.0 is D, and x < 60.0 is an E.

There will be no adjustments to grades at the end of the semester.  If you
missed a certain grade by a small fraction of a percent, I can't do anything
about that out of fairness to the rest of the class.  Grades will not be curved
in any way.

There is no textbook for the course, neither required nor recommended.  All
materials used for the course lectures and assignments will be widely and
publicly available and/or licensed open source.

## Absence policies and the conditions under which assigned work can be made up

For every course you are entitled to:

- Excused absences related to religious observances/practices that are in
  accord with [ACD 304-04](https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-04.html).
- Excused absences related to university sanctioned events/activities that are in accord with [ACD 304-02](https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-02.html).
- Excused absences related to missed class due to military line-of-duty activities that are in accord with [ACD 304-11](https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-11.html).

Attendance and participation are required.  You must bring a device to class
that is capable of logging into Canvas, since you will record your attendance
each day in the first 15 minutes of class through Canvas.  Stay until the end
of class if you mark yourself present, at the end of each lecture period I
reserve the right to choose a small number of random names (uniformly at
random) and check ASU IDs for those students on the way out the door.  *Any
instance of reporting yourself as present for a day where you were late to
class, left early, or did not come at all will be treated as a case of academic
dishonest*.  If you lie about attendance in Canvas on one of the attendance
quizzes I will give you an F in the course and report you to the AIO.

You will receive three absences without penalty, i.e., I will forgive up to
three absences in your grade calculation at the end of the semester.  There
will be no "bonus" points for students who do not use all of their absences.
In principle, you should be interested in learning the material and wanting to
come to class.  I only include attendance as part of the grade because without
doing this half the class chooses not to show up on any given day.  Even with
attendance as part of the grade this happens because students "cheat" and
report themselves as present when they are not.  If you don't feel like coming
to class regularly is worth your time, come discuss it with me in office hours
and maybe I can adjust my lecture style or you can switch to a different class
about a subject you actually want to learn about.

I encourage you to send me an email when you miss class.  Do not send Canvas
messages because I have no way to save them.  You can simply say "I missed
class for personal reasons", or you can give me a reason.  Please do not feel
compelled to give me personal details.  I won't judge whether the absence is
excusable or not, but if you need an incomplete, more forgiven absences for
grading purposes, or some other accomodation the paper trail of emails could be
helpful.  I am unlikely to accomodate extended absences, incomplete grades,
etc. without the Dean of Students office or SCAI advisement being involved, so
make sure you reach out to them when you run into life difficulties that will
affect your attendance and performance in this class (or any classes).

Note that absences that fall under policies ACD 304-04, ACD 304-02, or ACD
304-11 won't count against your grade or take away from the three forgiven
absences at the end of the semester.  However, if you want to utilize one of
these three policies you need to make that clear and have all the proper
documentation.


## Instruction Style

The course will be a combination of in-person lectures on Mondays and papers to read and discuss on Wednesdays.  Both will occur during the regularly scheduled class period.

For questions and answers regarding course materials and homework please use
the course's discussion board or come to office hours, unless there is some
compelling reason to use email.  Use email for course administrativia so there
is a paper trail (I delete old Canvas messages after they have been addressed),
but feel free to ping me in Canvas so I don't miss the email.  Feel free to
email me any time for anything, I won't shame you, but if you're asking
questions about the homework or lectures you're much more likely to get a
timely response in the course discussion platform than via email, and if you
email me about important things you might have to ping me because I don't keep
my email inbox clean like I do my Canvas inbox.

All homeworks should be done in Linux.  You can use other OSes, but if you need
help (tool recommendations, help with debugging, troubleshooting error
messages, etc.) I will only try to help you with OS-specific things if you're
using Linux.

You are responsible for your own file backups and time management.  E.g., feel
free email me, or send as a private post in Piazza, the day before something is
due, "I worked on it all day and then my VM crashed and I lost my file!"  I
won't shame you, but that's not grounds for an extension and I'm not going to
be able to do anything about it to make sure you submit your homework on time.
I recommend keeping your code and other work for this course in a *private*
repository (e.g., on github) that you periodically commit to.

## Classroom Behavior

Please refrain from anything that will distract you or others from fully
engaging in the class.  Disruptive behavior will be dealt with according to
university policies.  While classroom behavior is not explicitly part of the
grade, you are hereby notified that your attendance and classroom behavior are
considered as part of your overall performance in the course to the extent
allowed by university policies.

You may not record class discussions without permission.

## Textbook

As stated above, no textbook is required for this course.

## Readings:

Refer to the course website for readings on Wednesdays.  You are expected to
read the assigned paper(s) for each day and come prepared to discuss it.

## Assessment

Students will be evaluated on attendance, their performance on homework
assignments and final projects, and their performance on exams.  Details are
above.

## Homework Due Dates

Homework due dates will be posted in advance on Canvas and announced in class.
All times will be Mountain Standard Time, i.e., Arizona time.  

## Academic Integrity

Students in this class must adhere to ASU's academic integrity policy, which
can be found at
[https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/policy](https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/policy).
Students are responsible for reviewing this policy and understanding each of
the areas in which academic dishonesty can occur. In addition, all engineering
students are expected to adhere to both the ASU Academic Integrity [Honor
Code](https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code) and the Fulton
Schools of Engineering [Honor Code](https://engineering.asu.edu/honor-code/).
All academic integrity violations will be reported to the Fulton Schools of
Engineering Academic Integrity Office (AIO). The AIO maintains record of all
violations and has access to academic integrity violations committed in all
other ASU college/schools.

## Plagiarism and Cheating Policies Specific to This Course

This course has a zero-tolerance policy:

-Any violation of the academic integrity policy (detailed below) will lead to a failure on this course.
-The violation will be reported to the AIO.

If you need more time to accomplish a homework assignment, please tell the
instructor and ask for an extension.  Extensions will be considered for
circumstances that are/were beyond your control.  Do not attempt plagiarism.

For this course, you are allowed to use code snippets that you find on the
Internet as long as you specify clearly in the comment of your source code
where the code snippets come from, and the source snippets existed before the
assignment was assigned.  You are not allowed to upload any part of your
solution online or show it to other students.  Using other students' answers or
code, past or present, with or without a citation is seen as a violation of the
academic integrity policy.  You may or may not be asked to turn in your source
code for any given assignment.  In any case, if I suspect cheating I reserve
the right to require you to come to my office and show me a live demonstration
of your source code and answer questions to get full points.  Some assignments
are graded automatically by grade scripts with anti-cheating mechanisms
built-in.  Do not cheat -- it is not worth risking your grade and your academic
profile.

## Sexual Discrimination

Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis
of sex from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any education program or activity.  Both Title IX and
university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex
is prohibited.  An individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual
violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including counseling
and academic support, from the university.  If you or someone you know has been
harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information
and resources at [https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs](https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs).  
 
As a mandated reporter, I am obligated to report any information I become aware
of regarding alleged acts of sexual discrimination, including sexual violence
and dating violence.  ASU Counseling Services, [https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling](https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling)
is available if you wish to discuss any concerns confidentially and privately.
ASU online students may access 360 Life Services,
[https://goto.asuonline.asu.edu/success/online-resources.html](https://goto.asuonline.asu.edu/success/online-resources.html). 

## Copyright

All course content and materials, including lectures (Zoom recorded lectures
included), are copyrighted materials.  You may not share outside the class,
upload to online websites not approved by the instructor, sell, or distribute
course content or notes taken during the conduct of the course.  See ACD
304-06, "Commercial Note Taking Services" and ABOR Policy 5-308 F.14 for more
information.

You must refrain from uploading to any course shell, discussion board, or
website used by the course instructor or other course forum, material that is
not the student's original work, unless the students first comply with all
applicable copyright laws; faculty members reserve the right to delete
materials on the grounds of suspected copyright infringement.

## Policy Against Threatening Behavior

Students, faculty, staff, and other individuals do not have an unqualified
right of access to university grounds, property, or services. Interfering with
the peaceful conduct of university-related business or activities or remaining
on campus grounds after a request to leave may be considered a crime. All
incidents and allegations of violent or threatening conduct by an ASU student
(whether on- or off-campus) must be reported to the ASU Police Department (ASU
PD) and the Office of the Dean of Students.

## Disability Accommodations

Suitable accommodations will be made for students having disabilities. Students
needing accommodations must register with the ASU Disabilities Resource Center
and provide documentation of that registration to the instructor. Students
should communicate the need for an accommodation in sufficient time for it to
be properly arranged. See ACD [304-08](https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-08.html), Classroom and Testing Accommodations for
Students with Disabilities.

## Future Changes

Any information in this syllabus may be subject to change with reasonable
advance notice.  If there is a contradiction in the syllabus or between
something I said elsewhere (e.g., in class or on Canvas) and the syllabus,
please bring it to my attention and it will be corrected.
