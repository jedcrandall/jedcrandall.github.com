<h2>Plagiarism and Cheating</h2>

<p>This course has a zero-tolerance policy:
Any violation of the academic integrity policy (detailed below) will lead to a failure on this course.
The violation will be reported to the Dean's office.
If you need more time to accomplish a homework assignment, please tell the instructors and ask for an extension.
Do not attempt plagiarism.</p>

<p>As an ASU student, you must follow both the <a href="https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/ssm/ssm104-01.html">ASU Student of Conduct</a> and the <a href="http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity/policy">ASU Student Academic Integrity Policy</a>.</p>

<p>For this course, you are allowed to use code snippets that you find on the Internet as long as you specify clearly in the comment of your source code where the code snippets come from, and the source snippets existed before the assignment was assigned.
You are not allowed to upload any part of your solution online or show it to other students.
Using other students' answers or code, past or present, with or without a citation is seen as a violation of the academic integrity policy.
You will not turn in your source code for most assignments, and maybe not any assignment.  But if I suspect cheating I reserve the right to require you to come to my office and show me your source code to get full points.
All assignments are graded automatically by graders with anti-cheating mechanisms built-in.
Do not cheat -- it is not worth risking your grade and your academic profile.</p>

<h2>Sexual Discrimination</h2>

<p>Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity.
Both Title IX and university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex is prohibited.
An individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including counseling and academic support, from the university.
If you or someone you know has been harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information and resources at https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs.</p>

<p>As mandated reporters, the instructors and TAs of this course are obligated to report any information they become aware of regarding alleged acts of sexual discrimination, including sexual violence and dating violence.
ASU Counseling Services, https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling is available if you wish to discuss any concerns confidentially and privately.
ASU online students may access 360 Life Services, https://goto.asuonline.asu.edu/success/online-resources.html.</p>
