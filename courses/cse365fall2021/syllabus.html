<h2>TAs</h2>

<p>There are two TAs for the course.  I'll announce their names and office hours in Piazza.</p>

<h2>Course Description</h2>

<p>This course will provide students with a basic and comprehensive understanding
of the problems of information assurance (IA) and the solutions to these
problems, especially the security of information on computers and networks.
This course will focus on the IA technology as well as IA policy, management,
legal, and ethical aspects.</p>

<h2>Instruction Style</h2>

<p>The course will be a combination of lectures and homework assignments.
Attendance is required, but will not be recorded (i.e., honor system).</p>

<p>For questions and answers regarding course materials and homework please use
Piazza or come to office hours, unless there is some compelling reason to use
email.  Use email for course administrativia (requesting an extension, you need
a signature from me for some reason, etc.)  Feel free to email me any time for
anything, but if you're asking questions about the homework or lectures you're
much more likely to get a timely response in Piazza than via email.</p>

<p>All homeworks should be done in Linux, specifically MX Linux 19.4.  If you use
other Linux distros or other OSes you do so at your own risk, and with no
guarantee of support from me.  If you're familiar with Linux you can probably
get the homeworks done in your distro of choice without too much trouble.  I'll
try to help but will need to prioritize the needs of students who stuck with MX
Linux 19.4.  If you attempt to do the homeworks in Mac OS, it's probably
possible but it's going to be painful and I can't help you at all.  The same
goes for any BSD-based OS.  If your OS of choice is another UNIX, like Solaris,
I also can't help you with OS-specific questions and...seriously?  If you
attempt to do the homework in OSes that don't have a native UNIX-like shell,
such as Windows, you will most likely fail.  There are exceptions, but unless
you've been competing in CtFs with your OS of choice for years and already have
an environment set up for dealing with raw files, common file formats, packet
captures, ELF binaries, etc., please just use the provided Linux virtual
machine or install MX Linux 19.4 in a virtual machine of your own.</p>

<p>You are responsible for your own file backups and time management.  E.g., feel
free email me, or post in Piazza, the day before something is due, "I worked on
it all day and then my VM crashed and I lost my file!"  But, that's not grounds
for an extension and I'm not going to be able to do anything about it to make
sure you submit your homework on time.  I recommend keeping your code and other
work for this course in a private repository that you periodically commit to.</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>| Area     | Weight % |
|----------|----------|
| Homework | 100%     |
| Bonus    | 10%      |</p>

<h2>Homework Due Dates</h2>

<p>Homework due dates will be posted in advance on the class website and announced
in class.  All times will be Mountain Standard Time, i.e., Arizona time.  Late
submissions will be accepted with a 1% reduction of score per hour.</p>

<h2>Plagiarism and Cheating</h2>

<p>This course has a zero-tolerance policy:
Any violation of the academic integrity policy (detailed below) will lead to a failure on this course.
The violation will be reported to the Dean's office.
If you need more time to accomplish a homework assignment, please tell the instructors and ask for an extension.  Extensions will be considered for circumstances that are/were beyond your control.
Do not attempt plagiarism.</p>

<p>As an ASU student, you must follow both the <a href="https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/ssm/ssm104-01.html">ASU Student of Conduct</a> and the <a href="http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity/policy">ASU Student Academic Integrity Policy</a>.</p>

<p>For this course, you are allowed to use code snippets that you find on the Internet as long as you specify clearly in the comment of your source code where the code snippets come from, and the source snippets existed before the assignment was assigned.
You are not allowed to upload any part of your solution online or show it to other students.
Using other students' answers or code, past or present, with or without a citation is seen as a violation of the academic integrity policy.
You will not turn in your source code for most assignments, and maybe not any assignment.  But if I suspect cheating I reserve the right to require you to come to my office and show me your source code to get full points.
All assignments are graded automatically by graders with anti-cheating mechanisms built-in.
Do not cheat -- it is not worth risking your grade and your academic profile.</p>

<h2>Security token</h2>

<p>As part of the first homework, you will generate a 128-bit MD5 token that will
serve as a sort of student ID for the course.  You are not to make this token
public; share it with any of your classmates; share it with anybody other than
the instructor, yourself, and the TAs; find out the token of any of your
classmates; or in any way compromise the confidentiality policy that only you
yourself and the instructor/TAs for the course should know your security token.
If you violate this policy that will be considered cheating as per the policy
above.</p>

<h2>Sexual Discrimination</h2>

<p>Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis
of sex from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any education program or activity.  Both Title IX and
university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex
is prohibited.  An individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual
violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including counseling
and academic support, from the university.  If you or someone you know has been
harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information
and resources at <a href="https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs">https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs</a>.  
 
As a mandated reporter, I am obligated to report any information I become aware
of regarding alleged acts of sexual discrimination, including sexual violence
and dating violence.  ASU Counseling Services, <a href="https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling">https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling</a>
is available if you wish to discuss any concerns confidentially and privately.
