<h1 id="homework-2-part-2">Homework 2, part 2</h1>
<p><strong>Due date: 14 November 2022 at 11:59pm MST</strong></p>
<p>Homework 2 has two parts, this is the second one. It’s related to your class participation/attendance on Tuesday, October 25th and Thursday, October 27th, and is just a simple yes/no questionaire with two questions. The Google Forms link will be posted in Piazza. The links for videos and online meetings for these two dates to participate will also be posted in Piazza. Each question (i.e., each of the two days) is 20 points, for 40 out of the 100 total for Homework 2.</p>
<p>If you miss class and can’t attend the live presentation on October 27th, email the instructor.</p>
