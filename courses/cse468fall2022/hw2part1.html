<h1 id="homework-2-part-1">Homework 2, part 1</h1>
<p><strong>Due date: 14 November 2022 at 11:59pm MST</strong></p>
<p>Homework 2 has two parts, this is the first one. It has ten questions, 0 through 9, which are each worth 6 points for a total of 60 possible. The second part of homework 2 will be due at the same time as the first part, but will not require any time outside of the regularly scheduled class period unless you miss class (in which case you’ll watch a video of no more than 1 hour and 15 minutes as a make up assignment).</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>This is an individual assignment. DO NOT share your solution with others or use solutions from others. You may have high-level discussions with your classmates about it, and you may use/share any source code that existed before the assignment was assigned and is not related to any similar assignment or any past offering of CSE 468 or a related class at ASU. You may use any source code I provided for lecture purposes at any time.</p>
<h2 id="preparation-downloading-your-tarball">Preparation: Downloading your tarball</h2>
<p>Start by “ratcheting” your MD5 token from homework 1.1 to find out the name of your tar ball. Do the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="bu">echo</span> -n <span class="st">&quot;NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN&quot;</span> <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="ex">md5sum</span> <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="fu">cut</span> -c 1-32</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But replace “NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN” with your MD5 token. The output of the above command will tell you which tar ball <a href="https://github.com/jedcrandall/jedcrandall.github.com/tree/master/courses/cse468fall2022/hw21tarballs">here</a> is yours. Just add “.enc” to the end of your ratcheted MD5 token. Download and it decrypt it like this, using your original MD5 token as the password:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="ex">openssl</span> aes-256-cbc -md sha256 -d -in NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN.enc -out ~/mytarball.tgz</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You should be able to perform the above command on general.asu.edu or any Linux system. Then you can find your plaintext tarball for the assignment in your home directory, and decompress/untar it wherever you plan to do your homework. Don’t use /tmp on general.asu.edu for anything related to your tar ball, it caused students various errors and problems on earlier homeworks.</p>
<p>Do not share your tarball, MD5 token, tarball name, or anything that identifies you or your assignment in this way with others.</p>
<h2 id="ten-multiple-choice-questions">Ten multiple choice questions</h2>
<p><strong>60 out of 100 points</strong></p>
<p>In your tar ball, you’ll find a text file called “questions.txt”. The questions refer to packet captures and other info you’ll find in <a href="hw21files.tgz">this tar ball</a>. Choose <em>the best answer</em> of the four possible answers for each question.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-submit">How to submit</h2>
<p>You will copy and paste your answers into the Google form, no need to upload files. The Google Forms link will be provided in Piazza, note that every assignment will have a different Google Forms link to use. Try to avoid including any whitespace or newline characters, but the grading script should do a good job of removing them anyway. You will submit a string of 10 characters, corresponding to your answers for questions 0 through 9, respectively. E.g., you might submit something that looks like “babbcdbadc”, “aabddcbcab”, or “ddcaabcbab” with the exact letters depending on what the correct answers are. Note that the question numbers start at 0.</p>
