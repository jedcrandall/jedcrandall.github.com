<h1 id="how-to-make-up-points">How to make up points</h1>
<p><strong>Due date: 7 December 2022 at 11:59pm MST</strong></p>
<p>For any of the following homework assignments…</p>
<p>HW 1.2 HW 1.3 HW 2.1 HW 2.2</p>
<p>…if you didn’t get 100%, you can make up half the points you missed by submitted a new submission that is 100%. You have to get 100% for this, if you submit something with 99% it won’t change your score. But if you got N&lt;100% before the deadline and you get exactly 100% now upon resubmission, I’ll split the difference for that homework. Your score will be N + ((100-N)/2). E.g., if you got 50% and now get 100%, you’ll get a 75%.</p>

<p>Every assignment is still an individual assignment. DO NOT share your solution with others or use solutions from others. You may have high-level discussions with your classmates about it, and you may use/share any source code that existed before the assignment was assigned and is not related to any similar assignment or any past offering of CSE 468 or a related class at ASU. You may use any source code I provided for lecture purposes at any time.</p>

<p>I’ll post the original submission links in one Piazza post so you can find them easily. Refer to the original homework assignment for specific submission instructions.</p>
