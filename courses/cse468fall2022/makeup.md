# How to make up points

__Due date: 7 December 2022 at 11:59pm MST__

For any of the following homework assignments...

HW 1.2
HW 1.3
HW 2.1
HW 2.2

...if you didn't get 100%, you can make up half the points you missed by
submitted a new submission that is 100%.  You have to get 100% for this, if you
submit something with 99% it won't change your score.  But if you got N<100%
before the deadline and you get exactly 100% now upon resubmission, I'll split
the difference for that homework.  Your score will be N + ((100-N)/2).  E.g.,
if you got 50% and now get 100%, you'll get a 75%.

## Notes

Every assignment is still an individual assignment. DO NOT share your solution
with others or use solutions from others.  You may have high-level discussions
with your classmates about it, and you may use/share any source code that
existed before the assignment was assigned and is not related to any similar
assignment or any past offering of CSE 468 or a related class at ASU.  You may
use any source code I provided for lecture purposes at any time.

## How to submit

I'll post the original submission links in one Piazza post so you can find them
easily.  Refer to the original homework assignment for specific submission
instructions.
